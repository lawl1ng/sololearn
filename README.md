list of sololearn questions

Problems solved from the sololearn app. I completed the questions on the app, ranked as easy, medium and hard, and then copied the code via whatsapp onto my laptop (the browser version of the app doesn't have the coding challenges). 

I looked into downloading an emulator but that involved downloads of other programs e.g. virtualisation on Windows 11 and to be honest, it was too involved. Copying and pasting via whatsapp was more tedious, but it was simpler.
